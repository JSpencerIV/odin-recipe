    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p>
      <b>Flour:</b>All-purpose flour gives the banana bread structure. · Baking
      soda: Baking soda acts as a leavener, which means it helps the banana
      bread rise. · Salt: A pinch of salt enhances the overall flavor, but it
      won't make the loaf taste salty. · Butter: A stick of butter lends
      richness, moisture, and irresistible flavor. · Brown sugar: Brown sugar
      sweetens things up and adds a hint of warmth. · Eggs: Eggs act as a
      binding agent, which means they hold the batter together. · Bananas: Of
      course, you'll need bananas! Choose overripe bananas.
