    <h2>Banana bread</h2>
    <p>
      This banana bread recipe creates the most delicious, moist loaf with loads
      of banana flavor. <br />Why compromise the banana flavor? Friends and
      family love my recipe and say it's by far the best! <br />It tastes
      wonderful toasted. Enjoy!

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Flour:</b>
        All-purpose flour gives the banana bread structure.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Baking soda:</b>
        Baking soda acts as a leavener, which means it helps the banana bread
        rise.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Salt:</b>
        A pinch of salt enhances the overall flavor, but it won't make the loaf
        taste salty.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Butter:</b>
        A stick of butter lends richness, moisture, and irresistible flavor.

      <li>
        <b>Brown sugar:</b>
        Brown sugar sweetens things up and adds a hint of warmth.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Eggs:</b>
        Eggs act as a binding agent, which means they hold the batter together.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Bananas:</b>
        Of course, you'll need bananas! Choose overripe bananas.

    <h3>How to make banana bread</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Combine the dry ingredients in one bowl.</li>
      <li>
        Beat the butter and sugar in another bowl. Add the eggs and mashed
        bananas.
      </li>
      <li>Add the wet mixture to the dry mixture.</li>
      <li>Pour the batter into a loaf pan and bake in a preheated oven.</li>
      <li>
        Bake in pre-heated oven for a hour at 350 degrees. <br />You'll know
        it's done when a toothpick inserted into the center of the loaf comes
        out clean.<br />
        Make sure you let the bread sit in the pan for about 10 minutes before
        turning it out. <br />Otherwise, it might not stay in one piece.
